This is not a very pretty solution. In retrospect, it's probably like 100 lines longer than it actually needs to be, but that would require an almost completely different approach, I think. This program doesn't assume that the input is sorted from lowest to highest, which was admittedly probably what lead to my solution being as large as it is.

(Update 11/15)

The code compiles, and runs with expected behavior. The tiebreaker functionality for if both hands have two pairs is not added however.
