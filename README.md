Unfortunately, in its current state I was unable to build with CMake. I've written multiple tests, but found out a little too late (completely my bad) that my ubuntu distro in WSL is locked to CMake 3.10.2 - so I couldn't even build with the Google test framework. Took me about an hour to figure out what the issue was, admittedly.

This is not a very pretty solution. In retrospect, it's probably like 100 lines longer than it actually needs to be, but that would require an almost completely different approach, I think. This program doesn't assume that the input is sorted from lowest to highest, which was admittedly probably what lead to my solution being as large as it is.

I've uploaded this here as proof of my actual work, with plans to figure out how ridiculous this looks at office hours.
